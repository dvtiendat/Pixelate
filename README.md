Additionally, if you only want to pixelate a certain part of the image (for cencorship), by running the partial_pixelate.py, you can input the coordinate and the area of the image that you want to censor. Resutls are below:

You can change the pixel size by adjusting the pixel_w and pixel_h.

*Requirements*
* cv2
* Python 3.9.10
